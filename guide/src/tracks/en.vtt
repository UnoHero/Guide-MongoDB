- Hi and welcome to this video.

00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
- Here, I will explain how to set up MongoDB locally.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
- So first, you need a machine to set it up on.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
- Here, I have an Ubuntu VM to demonstrate.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
- You'll find the commands below.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
- First, run the command 'sudo apt-get install gnupg curl'.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
- Run 'curl' and create the file.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
- Load the local package base to update the package lists for available software.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
- Make sure your machine has the latest version.

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
- Just making sure the recorder is running.

02:00.000 --> 02:20.000
- Download the MongoDB program.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
- Start MongoDB.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
- If it doesn't work, you can run 'daemon-reload'.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
- Check if MongoDB is running.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
- Ensure that MongoDB starts with the machine.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
- Restart MongoDB.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
- 'Mongosh' is the command to enter the DB shell.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
- Now, I'll show you how to change the IP address of the database.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
- The 'mongod.conf' file is located in '/etc'.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
- Edit the 'mongod.conf' file.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
- Find 'bindIp' and change it to your machine's IP.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
- Restart the database to apply the changes.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
- Now, by running 'Mongosh', you'll be able to access the shell with the IP address you chose.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
- Thank you for now, have a great day ahead!
